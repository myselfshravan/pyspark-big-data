PySpark is a Python API for Apache Spark, which allows you to work with large-scale distributed data sets using Python.
Here are some examples of PySpark code that you can try:

- To create a SparkSession, which is the entry point to PySpark, you can use the following code:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("PySpark Example").getOrCreate()
```

- To create an RDD, which is a distributed collection of data elements, you can use the `parallelize` method on the
  SparkContext object:

```python
rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```

- To apply a transformation on an RDD, such as `map`, `filter`, or `reduceByKey`, you can use the dot notation and pass
  a function as an argument:

```python
rdd2 = rdd.map(lambda x: x * 2)  # multiply each element by 2
rdd3 = rdd.filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0)  # keep only even elements
rdd4 = rdd.reduceByKey(lambda x, y: x + y)  # sum the values by key
```

- To perform an action on an RDD, such as `count`, `collect`, or `saveAsTextFile`, you can also use the dot notation and
  get the result back to the driver program:

```python
rdd.count()  # returns the number of elements in the RDD
rdd.collect()  # returns a list of all elements in the RDD
rdd.saveAsTextFile("output.txt")  # saves the RDD as a text file
```

- To create a DataFrame, which is a distributed table of structured or semi-structured data, you can use
  the `createDataFrame` method on the SparkSession object:

```python
df = spark.createDataFrame([(1, "Alice", 25), (2, "Bob", 30), (3, "Charlie", 35)], ["id", "name", "age"])
```

- To perform SQL-like operations on a DataFrame, such as `select`, `where`, `groupBy`, or `join`, you can use the dot
  notation and pass column expressions as arguments:

```python
df2 = df.select("name", "age")  # select only name and age columns
df3 = df.where(df.age > 30)  # filter by age greater than 30
df4 = df.groupBy("age").count()  # count the number of rows by age
df5 = df.join(df2, df.id == df2.id)  # join two DataFrames by id
```

- To use Spark SQL, which allows you to write SQL queries on DataFrames, you can use the `sql` method on the
  SparkSession object:

```python
df.createOrReplaceTempView("people")  # register the DataFrame as a temporary view
df6 = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM people WHERE age < 30")  # write a SQL query on the view
```

- To create a machine learning pipeline, which allows you to chain multiple stages of data processing and model
  training, you can use the `Pipeline` class from the `pyspark.ml` module:

```python
from pyspark.ml import Pipeline
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler, StandardScaler
from pyspark.ml.classification import LogisticRegression

# create a feature vector from the input columns
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=["sepal_length", "sepal_width", "petal_length", "petal_width"],
                            outputCol="features")

# scale the feature vector to have zero mean and unit variance
scaler = StandardScaler(inputCol="features", outputCol="scaled_features")

# create a logistic regression model with the label column and the scaled feature vector
lr = LogisticRegression(labelCol="species", featuresCol="scaled_features")

# create a pipeline with the three stages
pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[assembler, scaler, lr])
```

- To fit the pipeline on a training DataFrame and make predictions on a test DataFrame, you can use the `fit`
  and `transform` methods on the Pipeline object:

```python
# fit the pipeline on the training data
model = pipeline.fit(train_df)

# make predictions on the test data
predictions = model.transform(test_df)
```

- To evaluate the performance of the model, you can use the `MulticlassClassificationEvaluator` class from
  the `pyspark.ml.evaluation` module:

```python
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import MulticlassClassificationEvaluator

# create an evaluator with the accuracy metric
evaluator = MulticlassClassificationEvaluator(labelCol="species", predictionCol="prediction", metricName="accuracy")

# compute the accuracy on the predictions
accuracy = evaluator.evaluate(predictions)
```
